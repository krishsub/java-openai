# Azure OpenAI Tester

This project can be used as a starting point to validate how to deploy
applications on Azure Web Apps (e.g. App Service or any another service) 
and have them communicate with an Azure OpenAI endpoint via standard 
authentication and authorization mechanims provided by Azure's OpenAI 
service.

## Running the application

The project is a standard Maven project. To run it from the command line,
type `mvnw` (Windows), or `./mvnw` (Mac & Linux), then open
http://localhost:8080 in your browser.

## Deploying to Production

To create a production build, call `mvnw clean package -Pproduction` (Windows),
or `./mvnw clean package -Pproduction` (Mac & Linux).
This will build a JAR file with all the dependencies and front-end resources,
ready to be deployed. The file can be found in the `target` folder after the 
build completes.

Once the JAR file is built, you can run it using
`java -jar target/azure-openai-example-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar`

## Project structure

- `MainLayout.java` in `src/main/java` contains the simplistic code
- The code is meant for testing - as it instantiates a new client connection
on each call to the Open AI endpoint which is quite expensive. 
- It also doesn't maintain any chat conversation history or context.
